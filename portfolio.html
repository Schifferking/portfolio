    <h1>Fernando Susarrey</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I studied computer engineering and learned to program in C and Java. Last year, I started learning web development through the Odin Project and now I know HTML, CSS, Javascript (basic level), Ruby (medium), SQL and Ruby on Rails. </p>
    <p>During these times I want to keep studying and improving my skills with the languages mentioned before and maybe start learning another one in the future when I feel confident.</p>

    <h3>My projects</h3>
    <div class="projects-container">
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Facebook clone like</h4>
        <p>Like the name suggests, it's a Facebook clone app, made with Ruby on Rails and it uses PostgreSQL as the database.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Flight booking</h4>
        <p>This project made in Ruby on Rails works like a page that lets you book a flight. You can search the flight by some parameters, select one and enter the passenger(s) information. When the booking is made, it sents an email to each passenger.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Admin dashboard</h4>
        <p>This is a page made with medium CSS knowledge. It displays a search bar, a sidebar with icons and links, some projects as cards and a section of some trending users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Log-in page</h4>
        <p>In this page, I use some CSS to display a nice log-in page. It uses images, forms and has some "responsiveness".</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Chess</h4>
        <p>This project made in Ruby is like the name says, a clone of the chess game. It works on CLI and works like the original chess game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Mastermind</h4>
        <p>It's made in Ruby and works in CLI. The player plays against the computer. The player chooses if it wants to create or guess a code. Also, each game can be saved and loaded in a file.</p>
